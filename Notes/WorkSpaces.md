# Workspaces in Metasploit

Workspaces help you keep track of all your hosts, scans, and activities  
You never want to mix data from one company to another  
Data is stored in **msfdb**

1. Check the status of database - ```db_status```
2. Workspace help - ```workspace -h```

```workspace``` - shows you workspaces  
```workspace -a (name of workspace)``` -- creates new workspace  
```workspace (name of workspace)``` -- this sends you to the workspace of your choice  
```workspace -d (workspace name)``` -- deletes workspace
